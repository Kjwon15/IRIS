IRIS
====

This is an Openflow Controller software created by ETRI. 
It is using Beacon-like NIO-based event handling mechanism, and has many core modules / app modules.

The core modules are basically ported versions of Floodlight core modules. 
Moving further, IRIS has simplified many of the Floodlight architectural choices,
to achieve better performance and provide much simpler development model. 
For example, attaching REST capability to your app modules is very simple with IRIS. 

The NB interface is mostly Floodlight-compliant. That means you can safely port your
Floodlight applications without much pain. 

The complete source code of this project will be released at the end of August.
