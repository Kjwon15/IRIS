{"name":"Iris","tagline":"Openflow Controller by ETRI","body":"IRIS\r\n====\r\n\r\nis an Openflow Controller software created by ETRI. \r\nIt is using Beacon-like NIO-based event handling mechanism, \r\nand many core modules ported from Floodlight including:\r\n\r\n1. Mac Learning\r\n2. Link Discovery\r\n3. Topology Management\r\n4. Device Management\r\n5. State Management\r\n\r\nThough much of IRIS came from Floodlight and Beacon (especially core modules),\r\nthe architecure of IRIS is much simpler than that of Floodlight,\r\nwhich enables easy development of modules and applications. \r\nMoreover, IRIS provides much better performance. \r\n\r\nIRIS is implemented by Java, and providing REST-based programming interface.\r\nThe REST Apis are compliant with that of Floodlight to guarantee the App programmers \r\nto easily port their Floodlight modules to IRIS.\r\n\r\nThe complete source code of this project will be released at the end of August. \r\n\r\nYou can find the document of this project here (https://github.com/bjlee72/IRIS/wiki). \r\n\r\nByungjoon Lee\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
