{"name":"Iris","tagline":"Openflow Controller by ETRI","body":"IRIS\r\n====\r\n\r\nis an Openflow Controller software created by ETRI. It is built on Beacon-like NIO-based event handling mechanism, and has many core modules ported from Floodlight including mac learning, link discovery, topology management, device management, state management, etc. \r\n\r\nHowever, though much of IRIS came from Floodlight and Beacon, IRIS has much simple architecture than that of Floodlight, which enables easy development of modules and applications. Moreover, due to the simplicity, we have observed that IRIS provides much better performance. We also did major re-factoring on the Floodlight UI in creating IRIS UI. In result, the rendering of underlying network dynamics is more compact and beautiful. \r\n\r\nIn creating IRIS, we have lots of re-factoring especially on following area:\r\n\r\n1. IO Event Handling\r\n2. Controller & Module Development Architecture\r\n3. REST API implementation\r\n4. NoSQL Database Integration\r\n\r\nOne thing you note is that the REST API is fully compliant with that of Floodlight. That means you can safely move your existing REST Openflow applications to IRIS. \r\n\r\nYou can find the document of this project here (https://github.com/bjlee72/IRIS/wiki). \r\n\r\nByungjoon Lee (bjlee@etri.re.kr) \r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
