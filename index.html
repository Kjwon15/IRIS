<p><strong>IRIS</strong> is the name of an Openflow Controller created by ETRI.</p>

<p>In Greek mythodology, IRIS (sounds ai-ri-s) is 
the goddess of the rainbow as weel as the messenger of the other gods. 
In developing IRIS, we have focused on creating an control plane architecture 
that can effectively deliver network adminirator's will 
to the underlying data plane, just like her.</p>

<p>Technically, IRIS is built on Beacon-like NIO-based event handler.
On top of the IO engine, we have ported many of Floodlight core/application
modules, including Learning Switch, Link Discovery, Topology Manager,
Device Manager, Forwarding, Firewall, and Static Flow Entry Pusher. </p>

<p>However, we do not want to stop there creating a spin-off version of the
famous open-source controllers like Floodlight or Beacon. 
Our vision is to create an SDN controller platform, 
initially based on Openflow Technology,
with following features (* not all of these features are to be included in the open source IRIS):
<ol>
	<li>Horizontal Scalability for carrier-grade network</li>
	<li>High Availability with transparent failover from failure</li>
	<li>Multi-domain support with recursive network abstraction
	based on Openflow</li>
</ol>

</p>

<p>Further, our ambition is to satisfy above goals with much more simpler architecture
that facilitates developers to use and customize IRIS to their needs.
For that, we have done lots of re-factoring on Floodlight module architecture
and successfully simplified it to give better performance, 
and to suggest a very easy-to-learn development model.
Further, to provide compatibility with Floodlight, IRIS REST API 
is designed to be fully compliant with that of Floodlight.

<p>Besides, we have modified the basic Floodlight UI to give users 
a network topology view that can be looked around more easily. 
Currently, IRIS UI supports the zoom-in/zoom-out/panning of the network topology
using the 'Touchpad' box located at the bottom-right corner of the topology view.
